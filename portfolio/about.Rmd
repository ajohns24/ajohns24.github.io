Hello! I'm a Professor of Statistics in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, & Computer Science at Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN. I earned my PhD in Statistics from the University of Minnesota in July 2009. Before returning to graduate school, I lived in Colorado where I received my MS in statistics from Colorado State University and worked as a statistical consultant at a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases (think bugs).



For more details on where I've been and what I've done, please see my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15BZSh5YQnUCYqx3sqrsBwxzNFAqEpisD0ffxuPYfJN0/edit?usp=sharing).
