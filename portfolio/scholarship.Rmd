My scholarship spans statistical theory, applications, & engagement.

My scholarship spans statistical theory, applications, and engagement. These interests are complementary.  Developments in statistical theory provide improved tools with broad applications and opportunities for engagement.  In turn, applications and engagement in specialized settings can illustrate weaknesses in the current theory.  


\


- **Statistical Theory**    
    My theoretical research investigates Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques and their application in Bayesian analysis.  A key question in this setting is "does this MCMC simulation accurately represent my Bayesian model?".  To this end, my research examines Markov chain convergence properties and their impact on the quality of an MCMC simulation.


\


- **Statistical Applications**    
    I'm inspired by the use of statistics for discovery through its countless applications.  These interests have produced interdisciplinary collaborations with scholars in economics, agriculture, entomology, primatology, geology, public health...


\


- **Statistical Engagement**    
    I'm driven to provide local organizations with powerful statistical tools that, when combined with the existing expertise of these organizations, can help advance their missions and advocate for the communities they represent. To this end, some of my past courses have collaborated with the Frogtown Neighborhood Association, West Side Community Organization,  Central Corridor Anchor Partnerships, and The Cedar Cultural Center. I have also consulted with Neighborhoods Organizing for Change. NOTE: These are very generous organizations. I can only hope that my students and I have given as much as we've received from these collaborations.
